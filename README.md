## Description

This task management app was developed as a team project together with Nicolas Voges and Timo Renken.

Log in as a guest or create an account with a password for testing purposes.

You can create tasks, edit them, and move them to a different column (or row, depending on the device).
There's also an overview of all the tasks and a list of contacts where you can add or remove contacts.
